				Anime Art Academy is here for you! We will teach you the methods you need to start learning, or

				If you want to get better, find an anime that love, and draw your favourite characters or scenes
				from that anime as much as you can. The passion you have for those characters will certainly
				show in your work, and it will give you the motivation and energy to continue working hard.

				Here at Anime Art Academy, me and all the other lecturers want to help you learn the technical
