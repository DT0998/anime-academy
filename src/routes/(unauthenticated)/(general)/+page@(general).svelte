				comment="Wow I am very surprised that the course actually is teaching important stuff, usually anime and
			manga tutorials or courses or even books just suck at teaching for beginners especially when it's in
			English, but this course actually has value and is teaching things beginners should know. This first
			lesson did a very good job at teaching the students to understand 3D and learn proportions, anatomy
			and technique (ghosting, drawing with shoulder, drawing arcs/curves) that will be very useful, while
			providing a very fun method to practice it. The method is not the most efficient but people will do
			it more just because it would be fun and you will improve multiple skills at the same time. So far
			I'm really enjoying this and it is obvious the instructor knows what he is talking about."
